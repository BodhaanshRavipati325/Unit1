<p>My factorial program : 
  def fac():
  num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
  factorial = 1
  # check if the number is negative, positive or zero
  if num < 0:
    print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
  elif num == 0:
    print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
  else:
    for i in range(1,num + 1):
        factorial = factorial*i
    print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial)  
  fac()
